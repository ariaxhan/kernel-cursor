# Subagent Output Rule

**CRITICAL: Agent work that only returns to conversation is LOST.**

## The Rule

```
EVERY AGENT TASK MUST WRITE TO FILES.

When running any agent task:
1. Specify WHERE to write (absolute path)
2. Specify WHAT format (.md, structured)
3. Agent MUST write findings to file BEFORE completing
4. Terminal output ALSO required (both, not either/or)
```

## Example

**BAD:**
```
"Research authentication patterns and tell me what you find."
```

**GOOD:**
```
"Research authentication patterns.
Write findings to /project/_meta/research/auth-patterns.md.
Also return summary to me."
```

## Where to Write

| Content Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| Research | `_meta/research/{topic}.md` |
| Analysis | `_meta/analysis/{component}.md` |
| Debug findings | `_meta/debug/{issue}.md` |
| Plans | `_meta/plans/{feature}.md` |

## Why This Matters

Without file output:
- Findings disappear when context closes
- Can't search or reference later
- Knowledge doesn't compound across sessions

With file output:
- Findings persist in file system
- Searchable, referenceable
- Feeds into session tracking system
