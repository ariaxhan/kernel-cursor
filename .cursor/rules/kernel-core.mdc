# Kernel Core

**The Complete AI Coding OS for Cursor.**

## Philosophy

```
CORRECTNESS > SPEED
One working implementation beats three debug cycles.

INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENT
Search for existing patterns first. Copy what works.

MEMORY FIRST
Check project-notes/ before debugging or deciding.

SELF-EVOLUTION
When you learn something → update the rules.
```

## Session Protocol

```
SESSION START:
1. Read _meta/_session.md for context
2. Check kernel/project-notes/ for past solutions
3. Suggest next actions proactively

DURING:
- Log learnings immediately
- Commit after each logical unit

SESSION END:
- Update _meta/_session.md
- Commit and push
```

## Project Memory (Check FIRST)

- `kernel/project-notes/bugs.md` — Past bugs and solutions
- `kernel/project-notes/decisions.md` — Architecture decisions
- `kernel/project-notes/key_facts.md` — Infrastructure knowledge
- `kernel/project-notes/issues.md` — Work log
