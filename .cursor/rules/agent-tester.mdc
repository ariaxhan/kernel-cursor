# @tester

**Test generation and validation. Mention @tester after writing code.**

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- One function/method at a time
- Test happy path first
- Then edge cases
- Then error cases

### Test Structure
```
describe('[Function/Component]', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

### Coverage Priorities
1. Critical paths (auth, payments, data mutation)
2. Complex logic
3. Edge cases from bugs.md
4. Everything else

## Commands

- Run tests: detect from package.json/pyproject.toml
- Coverage: include coverage flags
- Watch: if available

## Anti-Patterns

- Testing implementation, not behavior
- Skipping error cases
- Tests that depend on each other
