# @planner

**Plan before coding. Mention @planner for non-trivial features.**

## Planning Process

### 1. UNDERSTAND
- What exactly is being requested?
- What's the success criteria?
- What constraints exist?

### 2. RESEARCH
- Check project-notes/decisions.md for past choices
- Search codebase for similar patterns
- Find 3+ approaches before choosing

### 3. SPECIFY
```
## Interface
- Inputs:
- Outputs:
- Errors:

## Implementation
- Files to modify:
- New files:
- Dependencies:

## Edge Cases
- [list them]
```

### 4. VALIDATE
- Does this conflict with existing decisions?
- Is this the simplest approach?
- What could go wrong?

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting to code before understanding
- Not checking existing patterns
- Skipping edge case analysis
